<h1>Interactive Fluid Simulation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
We implement a fluid simulation that accounts for external forces such as user interaction. This allows for more realistic fluid simulation. We extend our work based on the paper.

</h2>Problem Description</h2>
    A lot of past projects in CS184 dealt with fluid simulations but do not account for the external forces such as user interaction in a realistic way. We try to use realistic fluid simulations that allow for user interactions and swirling the water. This can allow for simulations of water that have whirlpools and such. 

</h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    We plan on producing realistic simulations by modeling fluids with particles. The math behind the scenes would include formulas that consider pressure, surface tension, viscosity, and external forces. An example of what we hope to achieve is pouring water into a glass, which can be found in the paper listed in the “Resources” section of this proposal.
Here the water is being poured into a glass.
  Here the water is sloshing and settling.
Since our hope is that we want to create an interactive demo, we are trying to either render a website demo and use the mouse in order to display the interaction. In terms of measuring quality, we hope to measure the quality using a visual test of how the liquid simulation looks. It’s hard to measure quantitatively so we hope that the graphics demo is a good way to display the simulation. 
If things go ahead of schedule, we hope to simulate other liquids and fluids. It would also be interesting to look into seeing when the container itself moves over the simulation time. It would also be interesting to see how ice is acting in the water.

</h2>Schedule:</h2>
Week 1:
Setup basic fluid simulations with a lot of particles using navier-stokes equations 
<br></br>
Week 2:
Implement external forces that allow for tornados and some user interactions
<br></br>
Week 3:
Building out demo setup and add support for user interaction to exact forces 
<br></br>
Week 4: 
We hope to have a working demo with the realistic fluid simulation.

We will probably be using the eda/hive machines for most of the heavy compute and tests of performance. However, when computing and testing we will be using personal devices. For example, a good estimate for the hardware tested with is Intel i5-4690K (4) @ 3.900GHz with a NVidia GTX 3060 on Linux

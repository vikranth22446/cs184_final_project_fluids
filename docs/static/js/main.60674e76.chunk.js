Up to our project milestone, we had a working physics simulation for our particle system as well as a custom Blinn-Phong shader. During our test runs we noticed that performance was not addequate for realistic 3d fluid simulation.

Our simulations ran at very low frame rates: 100 particles ran at 45-60 fps and 300 particles ran at 1-3 fps.

We first used the valgrind profiling to track areas of the c++ code that required the most optimization. The physics simulation in our case was taking most of the time in serial fashion. We started by optimizing the code to take advantage of cache locality and using threads to run each particles computation in parallel. This provided a great speed up of 3-4x. In order to visualize our performance improvements, we added a FPS counter as part of our rendering logic. The next optimization was to realize that the operation of checking the forces that depend on a particle interaction with every other particle was n^2. However, the particles that mattered and applied the most important forces were close together. We needed to find a quick way to compute the neighbors of the particles in 3d space to find which particles for each particle affected it the most. We considered using OctoTrees and KDTrees, but we ended up using nanoflann since it had a fast open source implementation of finding neighbors. Even with the overhead of creating a new KDTree each loop, we were seeing another 3-4x improvement in the performance. Another optimization we did was to hardcode the constants instead of passing them in at runtime. We noticed a large speedup in our code due to the compiler being able to optimize the results. We used the compiler -O3 flat to build a performant release version of the code that does smart loop unrolling and other optimizations. After applying these optimizations, we were able to get a realtime simulation of 4000 particles at around 12-15 fps with 40 vertices per sphere.
